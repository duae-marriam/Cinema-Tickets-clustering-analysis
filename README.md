# Cinema-Tickets-clustering-analysis

This is a Unsupervised Machine Learning Exercise, in which the ML model is used to clustering and associations of different occurances.

Clustering and dimension reduction can be used in various ways, in several combinations; however, there are some field for which the clustering studies are not applicable. certain market or field specific dynamics do not allow us to perform USL studies based on the market specific factors. The clustering studies are numerous for understanding market segmentation and understanding consumer base. I have tried to create such a study based on viewership of certain movies across several cities in world. I expect to see some interesting insights from the study.

As an aim of this exercise, I intend to cluster the dataset of movie sales according to the expected observation of seasonality of sale of movie tickets, or observation of different amount of sales. ### Loading the necessary libraries
